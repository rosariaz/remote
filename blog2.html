      <p>This video explained the efficient and neat formatting/structure of HTML code. Looking over HTML code at a glance should give an experienced coder a general idea of where everything is located. Some of the concepts explained in the video were the placement of titles in the head area as well as headings in the body area. The title tag is used to give a definition to the webpage located in the tab. These tags and structures allow the page to know where to place all the elemnts of the code and give a better understanding of the information.</p>
