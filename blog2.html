          <p style="text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;">This video was a tutorial on creating a parallax effect using scrolling. This technique gives a very aesthetic appeal to any website and can be used in many creative ways. One example shown in this video is the use of the scroll to give the effect of a movig night sky. Scrolling up and down on this page will replicate a similar effect. The background stays in place while a div element moves.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word;">This video explained the efficient and neat formatting/structure of HTML code. Looking over HTML code at a glance should give an experienced coder a general idea of where everything is located. Some of the concepts explained in the video were the placement of titles in the head area as well as headings in the body area. The title tag is used to give a definition to the webpage located in the tab. These tags and structures allow the page to know where to place all the elemnts of the code and give a better understanding of the information.</p>
