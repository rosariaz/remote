          <p>This video explained the history and application of HTML
            in a short, concise time. The index.html file of a website serves as the instruction manual of a webpage by
            telling where and how to place things given in the code. Repetitive starting code is known as the
            boilerplate and autocompletes in modt code editors. The video went on to ellaborater on several HTML tags
            we've learned in class inlcuding headers, forms, and divs. Styles and scripts were also mentioned which will
            be applied using CSS and Javascript. These can also be applied through classes and can be implemented
            through seperate files.</p>

          <p>This video explained the efficient and neat
            formatting/structure of HTML code. Looking over HTML code at a glance should give an experienced coder a
            general idea of where everything is located. Some of the concepts explained in the video were the placement
            of titles in the head area as well as headings in the body area. The title tag is used to give a definition
            to the webpage located in the tab. These tags and structures allow the page to know where to place all the
            elemnts of the code and give a better understanding of the information.</p>
